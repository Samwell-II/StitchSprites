# StitchSprites
Python program that takes a folder of separate sprites and packs them into a sprite sheet.

# Example process
In the given example.py this program completes the following process:

1) Loads images from user's specified folder into ImageBatch object. 

2) ImageBatch.batch_process(ImageBatch.find_borders) is used to find borders in each image.

3) ImageBatch.minmax_borders() is then used to find the most optimal borders, that will not cut off a part of a sprite.

4) To crop images ImageBatch.crop_image along with the result from 3rd step is passed to ImageBatch.batch_process().

5) Finally, the cropped sprites are put together in a single file with ImageBatch.stitch(). The created image can be saved with ImageBatch.save().

# ImageBatch methods:
## __init__
Initializes the object by assigning values to ImageBatch.root, ImageBatch.paths and ImageBatch.bg_color.

## __load_filenames
Used during object initiation. 
Loads all filenames from given directory dir into a list. Will sort them, if argument natural_sort is set to True.

## __set_bg_color
Used during object initiation. 
Picks background color from an image or uses the one passed by user.

## get_image_path
Combines ImageBatch.root with given identifier to image path into a single filepath.

## show_image
Shows image.

## batch_process
A function that accepts any other ImageBatch method as an argument and processes all images with it.

## find_borders
Finds borders of a sprite in a single image.

## minmax_borders
Takes a list of borders generated by find_borders and finds the largest space that can contain the sprite.

## crop_image
Crops image with given border values.

## stitch
Creates empty canvas and places all cropped sprites in it.

## save
Saves image.

## __progress_message
Shows how many images have been processed. Used by batch_process.

## __get_pixel_mask
Overlays ImageBtach.bg_color over image's pixels and creates a mask. Used by find_borders.
